# BSBLL

A passion project to redesign mlb.com and learn front-end development at the same time. 

Both v1 and v2 use the mlb.com api to dynamically load and populate game data, standings information is pulled from ESPN.com.

## Project Structure

- `v2` - The currently under-development branch containing a complete rewrite of the web app using React on the front-end and Typescript, Node, and Express on the back-end.
- `v1` - The legacy branch using pure HTML, JS, CSS, Jquery on the front-end and Node and Express on the back-end.
- `mockups` - Early mockups to refine the design eventually implemented in `v1`.
- `frontend-only` - Website with hardcoded data originally submitted as the final project of the [Web Design Decal at UC Berkeley](http://wdd.io/).

## Live Demo

V1 of the webapp is currently hosted on heroku [here](bsbll.herokuapp.com).
